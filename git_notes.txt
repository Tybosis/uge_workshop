git notes

git init - creates a staging area. red x in the prompt means that the staging area is ‘dirty’
git status - gives you a message about the staging area.
git add - moves files into the staging area.
green check in the prompt means that the staging area is clean.
git log - history of the commits.
git commit - commit changes to HEAD.
git ll - git log in a ls -l style format
HEAD - label that points at the most recent commit.
branches are just labels attached to commits.

5 parts of a commit: message, id, timestamp, changes, signature

the git cycle: modify, add, commit, repeat!
-u : do this once for a push - ties my git push command to the master branch.
